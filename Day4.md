# 🗓️ Day 4 - Cybersecurity Learning Journey

## ✅ Completed: Cybersecurity  Project (CryptoV4ult)

Wrapped up my second cybersecurity project focused on securing a fictional cryptocurrency platform, **CryptoV4ult**, under the IIT Guwahati.

### 🔐 Key Accomplishments:

- **Secure SDLC Implementation:**  
  Transitioned from a traditional Waterfall model to a Secure Software Development Life Cycle, integrating security into each phase of development.

- **API Vulnerability Remediation:**  
  Identified and fixed common API vulnerabilities that could have led to data leaks to unauthorized third-party vendors.

- **Authentication Hardening:**  
  Analyzed and patched login system vulnerabilities including brute-force attacks, session hijacking, and username enumeration.

- **Threat Modeling:**  
  Built a detailed **Threat Matrix** to assess risks based on impact and likelihood, focused on authentication-related attack vectors.

- **DevSecOps Integration:**  
  Used **Trivy** to scan container images and documented mitigation strategies for high-severity CVEs such as **Shellshock**.

### 🧠 What I Learned:
- Practical application of vulnerability assessment techniques  
- Secure architecture design aligned with real-world threat models  
- DevSecOps tooling and documentation practices for business and tech stakeholders
